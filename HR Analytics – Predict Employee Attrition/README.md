# Project Overview

This HR Analytics project identifies patterns influencing employee attrition and retention. It helps organizations design data-driven retention strategies.

# Dataset

Source: IBM HR Analytics Dataset

Records: 1,470 employees

Target Variable: Attrition (Yes/No)

# Key Steps

Data Preprocessing: Removed null values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical fields.

Exploratory Analysis: Visualized attrition trends by gender, job role, department, and job satisfaction.

Model Building: Applied classification models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict attrition.

Dashboard Creation: Designed a Power BI Dashboard summarizing insights on attrition rate, job satisfaction, and salary distribution.

# Key Insights

Overall attrition rate: 16.12%

Employees with low job satisfaction and fewer promotions are more likely to leave.

Higher attrition observed in Sales and Research & Development departments.

Average monthly income of retained employees is higher.

# Tools & Technologies

Power BI, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SHAP (for model explainability)
